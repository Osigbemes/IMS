# IMS

My final year project on an intelligent monitoring system in health care

The project has an IoT technology integrated with it which gets patient vitals and uploads it to the cloud.

on the other end, the doctor and other medical personnel gets to carry on further diagnosis from the vitals as seen on their dashboard

Django comes into play here, it provides the apis for the front end developer to integrate and present a web view to the patient and doctors
